    <h4>16. What are semantic tags?</h4>
    <p>Semantic tags in HTML are elements that clearly describe their meaning in the context of the content, 
        such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, etc.</p>

    <h4>18. Difference between div and span</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag is a block-level element used to group content and create sections,
        while the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag is an inline element used to style or group small portions of text or other inline elements.</p>

    <h4>19. Difference between class and IDs</h4>
    <p><code>id</code> is a unique identifier for a single element, 
        while <code>class</code> is used to group multiple elements together for shared styling or behavior.</p>

    <h4>20. What are self-closing tags?</h4>
    <p>Self-closing tags are HTML tags that don't require a closing tag because they contain no content,
        such as <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>.</p>

    <h4>21. How many types of headings are there? How to decide which to use where?</h4>
    <p>There are 6 types of headings (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>), with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the main title and 
        subsequent tags for subheadings in descending order of importance.</p>

    <h4>22. Difference between block and inline</h4>
    <p>Block elements occupy the entire width and stack vertically (e.g., <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>), while inline elements only take up the space they need and stay within the flow of text (e.g., <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>).</p>

    <h4>23. Difference between em and strong</h4>
    <p><code>&lt;em&gt;</code> is used to emphasize text (usually rendered in italics),
        while <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> is used to indicate strong importance (usually rendered in bold).</p>
    <p><em>This is the emphasize tag</em><br>
       <strong>This is the strong tag</strong></p>

    <h4>24. What are attributes?</h4>
    <p>Attributes are additional information provided within an HTML tag that modify its
        behavior or provide extra details, such as <code>src</code> for an image source or <code>href</code> for a hyperlink.</p>

    <h4>25. Difference between HTML tags and elements</h4>
    <p>An HTML tag is the markup (e.g., <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>), while an HTML element includes the tag, content, and attributes (e.g., <code>&lt;div class="box"&gt;Content&lt;/div&gt;</code>).</p>

    <h4>26. Explain br tags</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag in HTML is a self-closing tag used to insert a line break,
        creating a new line within text or content without starting a new paragraph.</p>

    <h4>27. What are non-semantic tags?</h4>
    <p>A non-semantic tag in HTML is an element that does not convey meaning about its content, such as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, 
        which are used for layout and styling but don't describe the type of content inside.</p>
