    <H1>Bacltracking</H1>
 
    <p style="color: gray;">Bacltracking is a form of recursion <br>
        <br>
    The usual scenarion is that you are faced with a number of option, and you must choose one of theme.After you make your 
        choice you will get a new set of option;just what set of options you get depents on what choice you made.This procedure is 
        repeated over and over until you reach a final state.If you made a good sequence of choices,your final state is a goal state; if <br> 
        you didn't,it isn't.
    <br>
    <br>

Conceptuall, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that 
the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node,beginning with the root, you choose one of its 
children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf. <br>
    <br>
Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice,
and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try 
another choice at that node. If  you end up at the root with no options left, these are no good leaves to be found.        
    <br>
    <br>
     This needs an example.

    <ol style="color: gray; type=1">
    <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
    <li> At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
    <li> C is bad. Go back to A. </li>
    <li> At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
    <li> D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
    <li> At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
    <li> At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
    <li> At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
    <li> E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>

    In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. 
     There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we 
     have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)

    <h3>The backtracking algorithm.</h3>
    <div style="border: solid black">
<pre>
    <span style="color:rgb(0, 217, 255)">
        boolean solve(Node n) {

            if n is a leaf node {
            
            if the leaf is a goal node, return true
            
            else return false
            
            } else {
            
            for each child c of n {
            
            If solve(c) succeeds, return true
            
            }
        }
            
            return false
        </pre>
    </span>
    </div><br>
    <br>
    <div style="border: solid black;">
<p>
    Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If 
    solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to 
    some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.
</p>
    </div><br>
    <br>
    <h3>How does this worl?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>any child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any 
     child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this is done by the lines
    </p>
    <div style="border: solid black">
<pre>
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 187, 255);">
    for each child c of n {

if solve(c) succeeds, return true
        }
return false
</pre>
</span>
    </div>
  <p>
    Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal node,
     it is not solvable. This is our base case, in the above code, this is done by the lines.
  </p> 
  <pre>
  <div style="border: solid;">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 213, 255);">
    if n is a leaf node{
    if the leaf is a goal node, return true
     else return false
    }
</pre>
</span>
  </div> 
  <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:
  </p>
  <ul type="disc"></ul>
  <li>To search a tree:</li>
  <ol type="1">
<li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
<li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a younode, on wund you have searched mam all unsuccessfully</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>

     that is how your recursive algumthms are translated into machine or assembly language.</p>
     <div style="border: solid black;">
        <span style="color: rgb(0, 140, 255);">
        <pre>
            boolean solve (Node n) {
            put node n on the stack;    
            while the stack in not empty {
            if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
            if it is a goal node, retum true
             else pop it off the stack
            }
else {
   if the node at the top of the stack has untried chitaren
    push the text untried child onto the stack
  else pop the node off the stack
}
return false
            }    
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        Staring from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the stack, 
        and these are only pushed on one child at a time, hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree. 
         Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes at all time ther descendents. Therefore, 
         If the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goat nodes of all, and no solution to the problem.

</p>
<p>
    When the stack  algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal node.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, when the recursive algoritam finds a goal node the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of recursiveâ€¦
